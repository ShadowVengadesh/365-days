Sometimes I wake up by the door As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you Even now when it's already over I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face

Let it burn while I cried 'Cause

I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain

And I threw us into the flames Where I felt something die 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, The last time, oh Oh, oh

Let it burn, oh

Let it burn

And if somebody hurts you, 
I wanna fight But my hand's been broken one too many times So I'll use my voice,
 I'll be so fucking rude Words,
 they always win, 
but I know I'll lose And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours But I sang 'em all to another heart And I wanna cry, 
I wanna learn to love But all 
my tears have been used up
On another love, 
another love All 
my tears have been used up 
On another love, another love All 
my tears have been used up, 
up Oh, need a love, 
now My heart is thinking of I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours But I sang 'em all to another heart And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love But all 
my tears have been used up

On another love, another love All
 my tears have been used up

On another love, another love All my tears have been used up Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com
